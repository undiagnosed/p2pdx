# p2pdx - Decentralized medical data sharing

## Anonymity
Privacy is alsways a concern when it comes to medical data. Users themselves will be entering medical data into the system and must therefore ensure that they are not including any personally identifying information. Information should be entered in accordance with HIPPA anonymous data specifications as listed [here](https://www.irb.cornell.edu/documents/HIPAA%20Identifiers.pdf). 

Because of decentralized nature of p2pdx, users may also wish to hide their IP address. Users can configure ZeroNet to use Tor in order to acheive this.
